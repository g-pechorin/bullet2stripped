# bullet2stripped

This is a fork of "Bullet 2 Stripped" (so version 2.83? maybe?)
I forked it to get a lite CMake build.
I wanted a lite CMake build so that I could `add_subdirectory(...)` and embed the Bullet build into my project.

(The mainstream Bullet builds seemed to want to be the only project in the CMake build - understandable, but inconvenient)
