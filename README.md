# bullet2stripped

This is a fork of "Bullet 2 Stripped" (so version 2.83? maybe?)
I forked it to get a lite CMake build.
I wanted a lite CMake build so that I could `add_subdirectory(...)` and embed the Bullet build into my project.

(The [mainstream Bullet](https://github.com/erwincoumans/bullet3) builds seems to require that he's the only project in the CMake build - understandable, but inconvenient)

(... just use [mainstream Bullet](https://github.com/erwincoumans/bullet3) - unless what I've just described really scratches your itch)
