# bullet2stripped

This is a fork of Bullet 2 Stripped (2.83? maybe) which I created to get something that would build cleanly with CMake.
I wanted to embed the Bullet build into my project.
The mainstream Bullet builds seemed to want to be the only project in the CMake build.
While that's understandable - I didn't find in convenient and felt it would be easier to make this version.
