# bullet2stripped

This is a fork of "Bullet 2 Stripped" (so version 2.83? maybe?)
I forked it to get a CMake build which I could embed with `add_subdirectory(...)` into my project.

(The [mainstream Bullet](https://github.com/erwincoumans/bullet3) builds seems to require that he's the only project in the CMake build - understandable, but inconvenient)

If this doesn't make sense to you ; just use [mainstream Bullet](https://github.com/erwincoumans/bullet3)
